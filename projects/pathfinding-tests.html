									<h1>Pathfinding</h1>
									<p>Pathfinding is a very commonly found in games due to the need of allowing AI/NPCs to navigate the game world interactively. I originally had a go with using Unity's built-in navmesh pathfinding features as an introduction to pathfinding in a video game context. This got me interested in learning how these algorithms work and thus I began researching. </p>
									<h2>Simple Pathfinding (Oct-2020)</h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-simple-1.gif" alt="Simple Pathfinding demo" /></span>
									<span class="image right"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-simple-2.gif" alt="Simple Pathfinding demo" /></span>
									<p>I originally created a very simple and brute force pathfinding algorithm which was very inefficient and not appropriate to use in an actual game project. This worked by simply evaluating every surrounding tile recursively and then following the tiles. The left image shows the evaluation process. The right image shows the path creation process where you find the recursively find the lowest cost tile.</p>
									<h2>A* Pathfinding (Jan-2021)</h2>
									<p>One of the most commonly used pathfinding algorithms is the A* algorithm. This is a very performant algorithm for finding the shortest paths. The high level of performance and relative simplicity allows for it to be a common choice among game developers and programmers.</p>
									<img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-a-star-1.gif" alt="A* Pathfinding demo" />
									<p>The image below demonstrates how you calculate the values for the algorithm. The green tiles are tiles in the OPEN list and blue tiles are in the CLOSED list. The red tile is the target.</p>
									<ul type="square">
										<li>g cost - Distance from the start node for the path</li>
										<li>h cost - Distance from the target node</li>
										<li>f cost - Total of g cost and h cost added together</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In the demonstration, top left number is the g cost, top right is the h cost and bottom is the f cost</p>
									<span class="image"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-a-star-3.gif" alt="A* Pathfinding demo" /></span>
									<h2>Comparison of Performance</h2>
									<p>Once I created a similar test environment for both algorithms, I decided to test their performance to compare how they perform in different scenarios.</p>
									<p>My expectations were that the A* algorithm would be vastly more performant since, at least in my implementations, it was the only one that stops once you've found the path. The simpler pathfinding needs to consider every possible tile. </p>
									<p>I tested my implementations with identical scenarios and used Unity profiler with deep profiling enabled to monitor their performance. </p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-comparison-1.png" alt="Me using unity profiler" alt="" /></span>
									<p>All scenarios use RED as start and GREEN as target. </p>
									<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-comparison-s1-1.png" alt="Scenario 1" /></span>
									<p>This scenaro showed that the A* algorithm was much faster however the simple algorithm still was a very fast speed. This difference was unnoticeable during gameplay. I believe that they are similar in this scenario because all the tiles that are walkable are part of the resulting path therefore the simple algorithm hasn't got to consider as many tiles. As a result, I decided to test how they'd behave on a more open map. </p>
									<table>
										<tr>
											<th>Type</th>
											<th>Test 1</th>
											<th>Test 2</th>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>A*</td>
											<td>2.36ms</td>
											<td>2.46ms</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Simple</td>
											<td>7.05ms</td>
											<td>7.52ms</td>
										</tr>
									</table>
									<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-comparison-s2-1.png" alt="Scenario 1" /></span>
									<p>This scenario kept the 10x10 map size but opened up the level a bit more. The A* algorithm still performed very quickly while the simple algorithm showed a rise in length of time taken. This makes sense since the program is considering and evaluating a much larger amount of tiles than before. Although there is a large chunk of the map which is completely covered off, which isn't evaluated as a result and so that will reduce the amount of time taken.</p>
									<table>
										<tr>
											<th>Type</th>
											<th>Test 1</th>
											<th>Test 2</th>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>A*</td>
											<td>1.80ms</td>
											<td>1.65ms</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Simple</td>
											<td>13.64ms</td>
											<td>10.76ms</td>
										</tr>
									</table>
									<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="/images/projects/pathfinding-tests/pathfinding-tests-comparison-s3-1.png" alt="Scenario 1" /></span>
									<p>This scenario increased the map size by 4 to 20x20 and ensured that no sections were cut off. This showed a significant increase in time taken for each implementation with 'simple' having the worst time taken. These times are especially bad when you consider the fact that, in these implementations, they are running in the main game thread. This results in the game freezing for that duration which would disrupt the player's gameplay. Pathfinding algorithms are fairly simple to run in a seperate thread due to the fact it simply just takes some inputs and creates an output. </p>
